I learned how to:

- Create a single view application
- Use the project navigation and different panes
- Structure the project (MVC)
- Work with different types of files
- Add an UILabel 
- Add a ImageView
- Position elements on the screen
- Set an image with a rounded corner in the code
- Use shortcuts like Cmd + equal (=) to fit a label
