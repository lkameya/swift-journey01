I learned how to:

- Create a single view application
- Use the project navigation and different windows
- Project structure (MVC)
- Types of files
- Adding an UILabel 
- Adding a ImageView
- Position elements on the screen
- Setting an image with a rounded corner in the code
- Cmd + equal (=) to fit a label
